 Representing a camera in 3d world.
 IMPORTANT!!!: The camera's direction is -z after creation. So the rotation is kind of 
 different with normal CEObject in the scene. 
 
 Here's the difference:
 eulerAngles.X is used for up-down rotation,
 eulerAngles.Z rotate along the camera's direction, so it will rotate the entire screen.
