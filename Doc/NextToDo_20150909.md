# CETextureManager
- loadTexture returns GLuint to indicate GPU texture position

* double cache
GPU 8 slots of texture
CPU up to 50MB texture

* How?
- LRU(last recently used) to load texture into memory.
- textures in gpu will always remain in memory, and try not to realloc their index in opengl

* texture source:
- load from texture file
- dynamic rendering


# CEModel
- CERenderObject response for rendering
- Touch Events
- Object base properties
- ...

# CERenderObject
- vertexData
- CEMeterial
- textureIndexes (in opengles)
