# CETextureManager
- loadTexture returns GLuint to indicate GPU texture position

* 3 layer cache
1. Program 8 slots of texture		- currently in used
2. GPU base on GPU cache				- ready to used
3. CPU up to 100MB texture			- may be used

* How?
- LRU(last recently used) to load texture into memory.
- textures in gpu will always remain in memory, and try not to realloc their index in opengl

* texture source:
- load from texture file
- dynamic rendering, like shadow mapping




# CEModel
- CERenderObject response for rendering
- Touch Events
- Object base properties
- ...

# CERenderObject
- vertexData
- CEMeterial
- textureIndexes (in opengles)
