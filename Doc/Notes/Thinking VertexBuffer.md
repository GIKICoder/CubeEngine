# VertexBuffer
- data
- layoutInfos
- vertexBufferIndex
- vertexCount

? layoutInfos <-> program
throught renderer?
 glAttribVector(index, ..., stride...);

# Actually a progam can only deal with some specific data?
Program can offer its index info interface

who knowns everything? renderer?

should render known about vertex buffer? Maybe not, because the vertex buffer module should stand along.
